                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                    far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
                    of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                    pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                    irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
                    in the ocean.

                <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                    whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
                    realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                    with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                    extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
                    endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling

                    Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
                    expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
                confirmation in his lifetime.
                “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
                Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
                few,
                meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his
                son,
                Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who
                chose
                his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

                Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of
                inflation,
                known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
                Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a>knocked on his door with a
                    bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him the news.

            <p>
                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think
                that
                we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
                wrote in
                an email.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
                “Having
                news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                spread,
                astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will
                go
                down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
            </p>
            <p>
                John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
                called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
                beautiful
                and very convincing,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair
                of
                universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model,
                but he
                expressed reservations about inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting
                that
                the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
                European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this
                year.
                At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.
