                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                    far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
                    of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                    pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                    irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
                    in the ocean.

                <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                    whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
                    realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                    with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                    extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
                    endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
                    over.</p>

                    Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
                    expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                        THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we
                        can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
                        Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

                        NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from
                        one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches
                        of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

                        DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction.
                        You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how
                        much it has cooled.

                    <p>COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
                        coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in
                        every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>

                <div class="section2-part1-element">
                    <p>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place
                        before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot,
                        all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>

                    <p>INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after
                        the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
                        violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
                        universe.</p>

                    <p>FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of
                        polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early
                        universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>

                    <p>EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and
                        cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the
                        structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
